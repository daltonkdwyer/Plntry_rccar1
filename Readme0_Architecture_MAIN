PLNTRY ARCHITECTURE

Firstly, look at this image, which is a diagram of the architecture: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yht4nZN5aHjeAyuiQytCdhY9se5ctExtC6bPFkWdN00/edit#slide=id.p

Broadly, this project consists of three components:
    1) A WebRTC server, that connects video from two different peers (car and driver)
    2) A Flask websocket server that the driver's client has a URL to, which sends driving commands to the vehicle, e.g. STOP, FORWARD, LEFT, RIGHT, BACK etc.
    3) A Rasberry Pi which is programmed to automatically start a browser and the Flask server on bootup
        a. Including Ngrok, so the server which runs locally gets an external IP address
